# NixOS/nixpkgs#507531 darwin Mach-O page-hash scope

Generated: 2026-05-12 09:05:01 UTC

Daily scan across three darwin caches of the [NixOS/nixpkgs#507531](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/507531) page-hash bug. Fix PR: [NixOS/nix#15638](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/15638).

Lanes (one column per lane in the table below):

- `darwin` — `nixpkgs-25.11-darwin` channel (`store-paths.xz` published by Hydra's darwin-curated jobset; advances only when its darwin test-gate passes, so its rev can lag `release-25.11` tip).
- `release` — synthesised from `release-25.11` branch tip via `nix-eval-jobs --flake github:NixOS/nixpkgs/<tip>#legacyPackages.aarch64-darwin`, expanded to runtime closure via `cache.nixos.org` `narinfo.References` BFS. Captures cached darwin paths at the release-branch tip even when the curated darwin channel is gated on a poisoned-fish FTB.
- `unstable` — `nixpkgs-unstable` channel (trunk-combined, all-platforms; aarch64-darwin slice of fish here is on 4.6.0).

**Bistability note**: the bug's trigger depends on the Hydra worker's store state at build time — same source, two different drv hashes (driven by transitive stdenv churn), can yield opposite outcomes. The poisoned `fish-4.2.1` aarch64-darwin build at outpath `gngn7y9mn510m…` was the visible breakage that stuck the `nixpkgs-25.11-darwin` channel for ~7 days (2026-04-28 → 2026-05-05); the channel ratcheted past it after [`0c88e1f2bdb9`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/0c88e1f2bdb9) (staging-next-25.11 iteration 6, #513189) flipped fish's drv hash and Hydra's rebuild happened to land cleanly. The poisoned bytes remain in `cache.nixos.org` and still SIGKILL on first page-in for anyone pinned to a pre-pivot rev.

## Failure types

The bug's effect surfaces in three types of failure. Each type's membership and how we detect it:

1. **Direct failure** — cached binary's page hashes are stale; kernel SIGKILLs on first page-in. Detected by SHA-256/SHA-1 recomputation against every Mach-O slice in `cache.nixos.org`. Certain per binary.
2. **Load-time transitive** — binary is clean itself, but an `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` points at a direct-failing dylib; dyld maps the broken lib at process start, kernel SIGKILLs before `main()`. Detected by Mach-O load-command parse. Certain per binary.
3. **Build-time dependent** — package's nix expression directly declares a direct-failing package as `buildInputs` / `nativeBuildInputs` / `checkInputs` / `nativeCheckInputs`. Detected by evaluating the channel's nixpkgs aarch64-darwin package set and inspecting drv env vars. Graph-level only — not every listed package actually invokes the failing binary during build. Default view excludes `propagatedBuildInputs` (propagation threads the input forward, it isn't invoked).

| Type| darwin | release | unstable | Union |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **1. Direct failure** (slices) | 51 | 24 | 70 | 145 |
| &emsp;↳ distinct packages | 14 | 8 | 26 | 20 |
| **2. Load-time transitive** (binaries) | 0 | 0 | 7 | 7 |
| &emsp;↳ distinct packages | 0 | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| **3. Build-time dependent** (packages, default view) | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

## Canonical examples

- **Type 1 (direct)**: `fish-4.2.1/bin/fish` at outpath `gngn7y9mn510m…` SIGKILLs on launch on Apple Silicon — the bug's highest-profile case. End-user reports in [nixpkgs#208951](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/208951). This particular cached binary is no longer referenced by the current `nixpkgs-25.11-darwin` channel pointer (rev advanced past it on 2026-05-05), but it remains in `cache.nixos.org` and still SIGKILLs for anyone pinned to a pre-pivot rev — illustrating the bistability point: a clean post-pivot fish build at `s87z9chym2j5…` happens to coexist in cache, same source, opposite Hydra-worker outcome.
- **Type 2 (load-time transitive)**: any Mach-O whose `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` points at e.g. `ffmpeg-8.0-lib/lib/libavformat.61.dylib` fails at process start — deterministic from kernel page-in semantics.
- **Type 3 (build-time dependent)**: `direnv` declares `nativeCheckInputs = [ fish ]` with `doCheck = true`; its `checkPhase` runs `fish ./test/direnv-test.fish`, fish SIGKILLs, direnv fails to build on Hydra. Origin of [nixpkgs#507531](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/507531).

## Direct-failure slices by signature shape

Classes `linker-signed`, `codesign ad-hoc`, and `ad-hoc with Entitlements + empty CMS wrapper` are fixed in place by `fixupMachoPageHashes` (NixOS/nix#15638). The `Developer-ID-signed` class is skipped with a warning: the embedded PKCS#7 payload commits to the `CodeDirectory`'s hash, and the signing identity is not recoverable from inside the daemon.

| Signature shape | darwin | release | unstable | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| linker-signed ad-hoc, no CMS slot | 8 | 5 | 22 | 35 |
| codesign ad-hoc, empty 8 B CMS wrapper | 43 | 19 | 43 | 105 |
| ad-hoc with Entitlements + empty CMS wrapper | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| Developer-ID-signed (non-empty CMS payload) | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| **Total** | **51** | **24** | **70** | **145** |

## Affected packages

Flat alphabetical list of every package implicated by any tier, across all lanes. A package may appear on multiple rows if it hits more than one tier (e.g. `ffmpeg-8.0-lib` is directly broken AND its dylibs are load-time-linked by other packages).
