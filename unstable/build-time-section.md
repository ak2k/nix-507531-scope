## Build-time dependents

Packages whose nix expression **directly declares** a direct-failing package as `buildInputs`, `nativeBuildInputs`, `checkInputs`, or `nativeCheckInputs` (1-hop). If the failing binary is invoked during the package's build phase, Hydra fails and the package never reaches the cache. This is a graph-level relationship: whether each listed package actually invokes the failing binary during build is not statically determinable. The canonical confirmed case is direnv — its `nativeCheckInputs = [ fish ]` with a `checkPhase` running `fish ./test/direnv-test.fish`, origin of [nixpkgs#507531](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/507531).

Default view excludes `propagatedBuildInputs` / `propagatedNativeBuildInputs` edges (propagation threads the input forward; the listed package itself doesn't invoke it). The CSV includes all edge kinds for manual inspection.

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| Packages with failing seeds in declared build/check inputs (default view) | 0 |
| Total direct-edge rows (default view) | 0 |
| Total rows including propagated edges | 0 |
| Distinct failing seeds | 139 |
